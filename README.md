# Pico-W
Pico W Webserver

- Set up the Raspberry Pi Pico W and installed the required software and libraries for web development and GPIO control.
- Created a simple web server using Flask and tested the connection with a web browser on a different device.
- Added a HTML template and a CSS stylesheet to the web server to create a user interface for controlling the onboard LED.
- Implemented the logic for turning the LED on and off using the web server and the GPIO library. Tested the functionality and fixed some bugs.
